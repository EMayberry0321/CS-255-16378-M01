**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass was our client. They want to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. They asked us to create a system to help schedule these trainings and provide users with the ability to login and create accounts to access these training resources.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I feel as though I did particularly well with the creation of UML diagrams and Charts. They were easy to create and allowed my visually learning brain to better comprehend all legs of the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would rework the Functional requirements of my business requirements document. I feel as though I left gaps in what was required that I didn't catch onto until much later in the peoject. I would like to go back and fill in these gaps.

**Why is it so important to consider the userâ€™s needs when designing?**
The clients needs are our guidelines. If we do not adhere to them or take them into consideration, then the work completed will either be irrelivent or unhelpful. Without listening to their needs we cannot complete meaningful work.
